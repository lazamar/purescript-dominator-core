# purescript-dominator-core

The Virtual DOM and program core for `purescript-dominator`.

The [fastest Virtual DOM there is](http://elm-lang.org/blog/blazing-fast-html-round-two), now in PureScript.

----

This library is an adaptation in PureScript of Elm's [elm-lang/virtual-dom](https://github.com/elm-lang/virtual-dom). It aims to bring the Elm Architecture and Elm's fast virtual DOM algorithm to PureScript.
